        <p>The song is a reflection of Powfu’s introvert temperament.
        It speaks of his wallflower response towards girls and his peers in general- 
        he’s not outgoing and kind of don’t know a right way to speak to girls. 
        He directly guide an unnamed girl to step into his life and understand him.</p>
